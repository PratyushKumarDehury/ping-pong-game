#Ping-Pong-Game (Made using HTML5 CSS3 and JavaScript)


#About the project:-

In this project I have created a basic version of Ping Pong Game using HTML CSS and JavaScript to increease my command over them.
Press ENTER to start game and use arrow or (A and D) key to move the rod in right-left direction.
This is a single player computer game where a player hit ball from the rods to increase their score and if player miss to hit ball then game is over.
On every hitting on rod and left right side of PC screen there is a sound effect and there is also a sound effect on game over.
I have also use LOCAL STORAGE to store the highest score that the player made and show alert on game start and on game over.
